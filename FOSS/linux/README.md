# LINUX

##Which Distro Should I Use?
If you've never used linux before and don't know how to use the command line, distros like mint and ubuntu are perfect for you. They have GUI's similar to that of windows(but faster and more customisable). 
If you understand how to use the terminal and are looking to dive deeper into linux you could try using distros like manjaro or arco linux or a tiling window manager like i3 or qtile.

## Understanding Linux
The best short guide to understanding the terminologies and different parts off linux is the [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/ricerous_info) wiki.


## Ricing Resources
Ricing was originally a term used to describe the act of customising cheap cars to make them appear faster than they are, but in linux ricing usually means making your setup of linux faster and more visually appealing. See the subreddit [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary) for more details
Below are a few of our favourite ricing resources(feel free to add your own):

 - [Book on ricing](https://github.com/feroldi/ricing)

## Minimal C programs
Don't let the word minimal fool you the programs I'm referring are just as powerful if not more powerful than any program written in Java or (god forbid) flutter. 
They are usually written by hobbyists with the goal of having a fairly simple to understand, short(usually less than 2000 lines of code) and fast programs. 
These programs usually use the [Xlib](https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/introduction/) library to interact with X11(the default graphical server for most linux distros). If you're looking to understand or write native graphical applications for linux then these programs are a great place to start.
If you're looking for some minimal programs to get started with go through the websites listed in the section below   

## Weird and wonderful places on the linuxnet
These websites have cool linux programs and utilities but more importantly, they are just really cool websites. Each one is like its own little maze for you to explore. Exploring them will be sure to make you long for the days of the hardcore technologists and hackers and will inspire you to become like them. These websites are listed in increasing order of weirdness.
